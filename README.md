## Introduction

Welcome to the Jupiter HR Management System repository! This project is a software solution designed to meet the specific needs of Jupiter Apparels, a multinational apparel company with branches in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The primary goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use Human Resource Management System (HRMS) to replace Jupiter's current SAP-based system.

## Project Overview

Jupiter Apparels currently uses SAP as their ERP system to manage various aspects of their organization. However, the management has identified several challenges with the current system, including the need for specialized SAP engineers for even minor modifications and the difficulty of training non-technical employees to use the system effectively. To address these issues, our team has been tasked with developing a user-friendly HRMS as the initial phase of the project.

If the HRMS proves successful, Jupiter Apparels intends to migrate other key functions, such as payroll and inventory management, to our system.

## Features

Our HR Management System for Jupiter Apparels will offer the following features:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy an intuitive and user-friendly interface that minimizes the need for extensive training, ensuring that all employees can easily navigate and use the system.
  
- **Personal Information Management (PIM)**: Access comprehensive tools for efficiently managing employee data. This includes overseeing personal information, tracking attendance, and conducting performance evaluations with ease.
  
- **Absence Management**: Simplify absence management processes by providing streamlined tools for requesting and managing leave.
  
- **Reporting Module**: Automate payroll calculations, tax deductions, and payslip generation with our reporting module. This feature not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in financial processes.
  
- **User Management and Authorization**: Efficiently manage user access and authorization, allowing you to control who can access various parts of the system. Customize access levels to aid decision-making and compliance efforts.

## Usage
